  # Plot reliability diagram for an ensemble forecast
  #
  # Usage: reliability(data, u, nbins, threshold, reliabfile,maintitle)
  #
  # Arguments:
  #    data: a table with the following structure
  #           first  column = year
  #	     second column = month
  #	     third  column = observation
  #	     forth  column = ensemble member 1
  #	     fith   column = ensemble member 2
  #	     .
  #	     .
  #	     .
  #	     last   column = ensemble member k
  #
  #    u: threshold value or quantile (e.g. u=50 for the 0.5 quantile, 
  #       i.e. the median of the observations) that defined the event of 
  #       interest to be forecast
  #
  #    nbins: number of probability bins 
  #
  #    threshold: Logical. If TRUE (Default) uses the value u as threshold, if
  #               FALSE u should have the value of the quantile to be computed
  #  
  #
  #    reliabfile: string of charaters with the name of the file where
  #            the threshold value or quantile u will be written
  #
  # graphvaluefile: string of charaters with the name of the file where
  #                 the data used to produce reliability diagram plot will
  #                 be written
  #                   
  #    maintitle: String containing the text for the reliability diagram title
