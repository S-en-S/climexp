The data of <a href="http://climexp.knmi.nl/wipefeet.cgi?http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/temperature/" target="_new">CRUTEM3</a> extend far into the sea; and the data of <a href="http://climexp.knmi.nl/wipefeet.cgi?http://hadobs.metoffice.gov.uk/hadsst2/" target="_new">HadSST2</a> extend far inland.  Grid boxes with only a tiny fraction of land are included in CRUTEM3, and grid boxes with only a tiny fraction of sea are included in HadSST2.  The temperatures of these grid boxes are not very reliable, especially for HadSST2.  In the merged <a href="http://climexp.knmi.nl/wipefeet.cgi?http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/temperature/" target="_new">HadCRUT3</a> dataset these boxes are often weighed strongly due to the low variability.

<p>To get correct trends in Europe (with a convoluted coast line) I have constructed a <a href="http://climexp.knmi.nl/select.cgi?id=FORM_EMAIL&field=crutem3_hadsst2">new combination of CRUTEM3 and HadSST2</a>, in which the overlap is weighed according to the fraction of land and sea.  This fraction has been computed from the 0.5&deg; CRU TS 2.1 dataset land/sea mask.  It extends a little too far into the sea, but this has the good property that it downplays the unreliable coastal HadSST2 data.

<p>The combined dataset therefore consists of
<ul>
<li>CRUTEM3 wherever HadSST2 is undefined
<li>HadSST2 wherever CRUTEM3 is undefined
<li>an area-weighed average where both are defined
</ul>
Note that near islands this can give rise to spurious signals when ships pass by.  Use with care.
