The default output is to produce 2D maps (or vertical sections).  These maps are displayed as a relatively low-resolution png bitmap, but can be downloaded in high-resolotion eps and pdf formats.  A data file describing the map is also available in netcdf, hdf and ascii formats.

<p>An alternative is to produce a kmz bitmap file that can be loaded into 3D visiualisation programmes such as Google Earth, World Wind, ArcGIS.  The veiwing point is deduced from the e-mail address.
