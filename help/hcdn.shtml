<div class="alineakop">HCDN US daily runoff data</div> 

The <a href="http://water.usgs.gov/pubs/wri/wri934076/1st_page.html"
target="_new">HCDN dataset</a> contains daily unoff data from the US
only over the period 1874-1988.  In general hydrologists are not keen to share
their data, and with the exception of the US it is almost impossible
to get hydrological data for use in the Climate Explorer.

<p>This is the best I could find a few years ago, please contact <a
href="http://www.knmi.nl/~oldenbor/">me</a> if you know of a more
extensive or up-to-date dataset.
