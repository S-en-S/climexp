<div class="alineakop">Plot colours</div> 
The colour scale that is used for the plots.  The default is optimised for anomaly plots, with a grey band in the middle that is two times larger than the colour bands.  Yellow-orange-red to the positive values, green-blue to negative ones.  For precipitation and ice anomalies a reversed colour scale is more intuitive.

<p>Note that a distinction is made between values around zero, which are grey, and undefined value, which are white.

<p>For non-anomaly values (mean, standard deviation, ...) there are colour scales available that do not have grey in the middle.
