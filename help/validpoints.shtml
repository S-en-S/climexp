<div class="alineakop">Percentage valid points</div> 
The area average is only considered valid when at least this many
valid points are included.  Enter a smaller number to get 
more valid data in the resulting time series, but the quality of these
data will be lower.  A higher number gives fewer but higher-quality
data points.
