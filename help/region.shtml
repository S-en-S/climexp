<div class="alineakop">Select plot region</div> 
This option selects the region to plot.  Note that for most operations
the whole field is computed, so that one can choose other regions
afterwards.  Only for EOFs, SVDs, EOTs and verification measures the data is
actually restricted to the region indicated.

<p>The default is the area of the field.  When the field is global,
the default longitude range is from 180&deg;W to 180&deg;E
(Europe/Africa-biased).

<p>If a field is unexpectedly empty, try adding or subtracting
360&deg; to the longitude.  I try to map everything to a common range,
but this sometimes fails.

<p>Degrees south and west should be indicated by negative numbers. Note that ranges should always be from negative to positive, so from south to north and west to east. A range -10&deg;N to -20&deg;N will often not work as it goes from north to south. A range -10&degW to -20&deg;W will give a plot almost circling the earth, which is probably not what you want.

<p>A small region will select a high-resolution background map. for a
large region a low-resolution version is used.

<div class="alineakop">Plot type</div>
When the maps are computed for a range of time values (seasons or
lags) there is the possibility to draw the results as a time-lon or
time-lat plot.  The other spatial dimension then indicates a range
over which the values are averaged
