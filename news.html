<tr><td>09-jan-2013</td><td>Changed the way countries are treated: if a region (island) is too small to have a grid point in the interior it contributes proportional to its area. This way small countries still give a result, even though it may not be completely representative of the area of the country itself.</td></tr>

<tr><td>20-jun-2013</td><td>Fixed a serious bug in the field filtering routine that wrote Feb 29 in non-leap years as zeroes into the output file (as Mar 1 the first time, Mar 2 the  second, etc). This also meant the output was too long. I hope no-one else was bitten by this one.</td></tr>

<tr><td>16-apr-2013</td><td>The cause of yesterday's crash seems to be a course at ICTP that overwhelmed the server. Please, when using the Climate Explorer for teaching, realise that it only has 6GB of RAM, which gives an upper limit to the number of fields that can be analysed simultaneously. (ten small, low-resolution ones, only two CRU TS 0.5&deg; fields at the same time). It is essential to tell the students not to re-try when the machine is slow, as that will bring it down completely. Contact me for more tips. I have implemented a simple `too busy' check, hope that helps next time.</td></tr>

<tr><td>10-oct-2012</td><td>Changed the default land/sea option to be 50% land and 50% sea, this works best for the CMIP5 fields with fractional land/sea grid boxes. The old options of 100% land and 100% sea are still available but hidden by default.</td></tr>
<tr><td>03-oct-2012</td><td>Added ERA-interim upper-air fields, changed the update script to obtain all ERA-interim fields via the python MARS interface. (Learned python.) Should update more regularly from now on.</td></tr>

There was a systematic error which identified valid station values as 'excessive', removing them from the gridding process.
