<h2>KNMI Climate Explorer: some examples</h2>

Here are some examples how to use the KNMI Climate Explorer: <a
href="#tombouctou">climate, variability and predictability at one
station</a>, <a href="#warming">a poor man's global warming
fingerprinting</a>, <a href="#nino">the standard effects of El
Ni&ntilde;o</a>.   If you have not yet already done so, <a
href="index.html" target=_new>log in</a> with your e-mail address.

<a name="tombouctou"><h3>Climate, climate variability and seasonal 
predictability at one station</h3></a>

You are going to Tombouctou next August, and would like to know
whether to bring an umbrella
<ol>

<li>Underneath the world map on the page "select time series", select
"precipitation" and type "Tomb" (you are not sure about the spelling
of the rest of the name) into the field after "containg".  Press [Get
stations].

<li>This gives a list of eight stations, the fifth one is TOMBOUCTOU
MALI (MALI), coordinates: 16.80&deg;N, 3.00&deg;W.  The link "more
info" reveals that the town has a population of 20000, and is located
in a marsh,swamp.  Go back and follow the link "get data".

<li>The following page gives a time series of precipitation at
Tombouctou from 1897-1996 with a gap at 1915-1921.    The second plot
is more interesting, it shows that the annual rainfall is concentrated
in August, with an average rainfall of 77.65mm and standard deviation
41.85mm (click on "raw data" or scroll down a bit to read off the
numbers).  This is almost the same as De Bilt (82mm, 43mm).  Do take
an umbrella.

<li>Clicking on "month" reveals that the August rainfall has a clear
decadal trend: the 1970s and 1980s were drier than the average.
However, in the 1990s rainfall came back to normal.  No clear case to
leave the umbrella at home.  Go back.
<li>The standard correlations underneath the yearly cycle show that
the August rainfall (month 8) is not correlated to El Ni&ntilde;o
(r=-0.01) or the NAO (r=+0.15).  In July, the onset of the rainy
season, there could be a connection with El Ni&ntilde;o.

<li>If you want to investigate this connection further, select "NINO3"
under "system-defined timeseries", and under "common options" select
the starting month [Jul] and press [Correlate].  The resulting
scatter plot shows that the very wettest years have all been La
Ni&ntilde;a years, but the two driest years have also been during a La
Ni&ntilde;a.  The tercile plot also shows that there is not much you
can say about the chances of a wet/normal/dry July at Tombouctou if
you can predict the NINO3 index.

<li>The situation is slightly better if you look at the whole rain
season, July-September.  Go back to the "common options" and select
[averaging] over [3] months and press [Correlate].  With a stromg El
Ni&ntilde;o at this time of the year (NINO3>+1.25) there were five
years with drier than average conditions, and one with wetter than
average (1905), so it seems likely it will be drier next time.  The
tercile plot gives a forecast of 50:30:20 for a NINO3 index of 1.4.
During a La Ni&ntilde;a the spread is greater, with a 20:40:40
forecast for NINO3 at -1.

<li>Finally, just to make sure, go back to "common options" and change
"lag" to [0:24].  The lag correlations show the NINO3-autocorrelation
function in reverse; nothing interesting here.

<li>Are there other oceans where the surface temperature was a
predictor for Timbouctou rainfall?  Go back to the correlations menu,
and select "temperature anomalies" under "field: observations".  We
still have starting month [Jul], [averaging] over [3] months (to cut
down the noise), it is wise to also choose lag: [3] months to avoid
cause/effect ambiguities.  Press [correlate] and wait a while.
Besides the ENSO-region, SST in the Mediterranean and North Atlantic
stand out.  However, these disappear when one takes year-on-year
differences ("difference"); so the interannual variability seems
(tenuously) connected to ENSO only.  The time series are probably not
long enough, and the data not homogeneous enough, to say much about
the decadal variability.  Please send me the preprint if you feel you
can do something here.

</ol>

<a name="warming"><h3>Poor man's global warming fingerprinting</h3></a>

What have been the patterns associated with global warming over the
past 100 years?
<ol>

<li>Go to the first page of the KNMI Climate explorer, select from the
list of "climate indices" the Jones "global average temperature".

<li>Click on [correlate with a field]

<li>Select under "observations" the Jones "temperature anomalies", 
and choose to plot the "slope".  Under "options" select starting month [Jan],
[averaging] over [12] months for yearly averages.

<li>The automatic colour-chosing scheme is suboptimal due to the huge
slope at Svelbard (Spitsbergen), go back and set the contours from
-2.5 to 2.5.

<li> Now one can see that the world has warmed remarkably uniformly
(slope=1).  In the Arctic the slope is much larger than one
(snow-albedo feedback); and the Pacific decadal pattern and the North
Atlantic have been cooling when the rest of the world became warmer.
Also the equatorial eastern Pacific has become warmer than the
averaged earth.  It is not yet known whether these oceanic effects are
connected to global warming, or are just coincidences.

</ol>

<a name="nino"><h3>The standard effects of El Ni&ntilde;o</h3></a>

What were the effects of <a href="../enso/nino/nino.html">El
Ni&ntilde;o and La Ni&ntilde;a</a> over the last hundred years?
<ol>

<li>Select the NINO3 series in the list of climate indices

<li>(Note that the variability is largest in december, that the
correlation with itself is 1.00, and the correlation with the NAO
essentially zero in winter)

<li>Select under "field: observations" the CRU Hulme "precipitation
anomalies", starting month [all], [averaging] over [3] months
(traditional seasons), and press [correlate].  Wait a while.

<li>Note the very strong seasonality in most signals.

<li>Do the same for temperature.

<li>Split up the effects of El Ni&ntilde;o (index>0) and La
Ni&ntilde;a (index<0) if you are in a particularly thorough mood.

<li>Compare the DJF and JJA temperature and precipitation plots with
the canonical pictures of the effects of <a
href="http://www.knmi.nl/onderzk/oceano/enso/nino/warm.gif">El Ni&ntilde;o</a> and <a
href="http://www.knmi.nl/onderzk/oceano/enso/nino/cold.gif">La Ni&ntilde;a</a> based on the
Ropelweski and Halpert articles.  Please let me know if you have
abstracted the correlation plots to new, improved, canonical pictures.
(A year later: I made <a
href="http://www.knmi.nl/onderzk/oceano/enso/effecten.html">those plots</a> myself.)
