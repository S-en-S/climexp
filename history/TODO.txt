KNMI Climate Explorer

KNOWN PROBLEMS
- Older versions of Netscape (3.1 at least) do not support PNG images.
  I am afraid you will have to upgrade, or get one of the PNG plug-ins.
  Due to patent problems I cannot use GIF.
- On the KNMI computers Internet Explorer refuses to download raw data 
  (.dat) and postscript (.ps.gz) files.  On at least one other it works.
  Workaround: use Netscape; KNMI does not support IE.
- OmniWeb 2.7 has a bug that means your email address is lost when you 
  click on the map.  Workaround: fill it out by hand (right-click and modify)

TODO
- make plots of correlations of station data with an (interpolated) field
- fieldcorrelations => time series
- make anomalies better-defined
- kill bugs when reading data not starting from Jan.
- wavelet transform?
- investigate possibility to add 3D ocean analyses, 3D atmophere data
- try to get Lisboa-Iceland NAO? (Stephenson)
- add bandpass filtering
- add possibility to combine timeseries to a longer one (tough one)
- add ocean subsurface data
- add possibility to project a pattern (correlation field) onto a field
- add K-S test to fit of histograms

DONE
12-apr-2001
- Added the possibility to select only part of a time series (handy if part
  looks unreliable) (Femke)

  to specify the base period (Magdalena).
8-mar-2001
- Fixed "fields too large" Y2K+1 bug, fixed error message for significances
  Kaplan (Andreas)
3-mar-2001
- Added a few NCEPNCAR fields from their web site ("hours since 1-1-1 0:0:0")
2-mar-2001
- Added a few ERA15 fields that I needed to compare with NCEP/NCAR
23-feb-2001
- Added the possibility to have coloured stationmaps, either red/blue with
  the size proportional to r, or a rainbow with fixed size; indignificant
  correlations are greyed out.

  only for GHCN precip and temperatures (Gerrit)
8-feb-2001

  necessitated a complete rewrite of all get* programs.
31-jan-2001
- polished stationplots a bit (title, legenda)
30-jan-2001
- Fixed bug in getprcp, gettemp, getrunoff: there are some stations with 
  lowercase names that would not show up when searching for a name
29-jan-2001
- implemented box in getsealevel, getrunoff, getusrunoff
- make plots with circles for the correlation on the spots of these stations

  implemented in getprcp, gettemp, getpress, getsealev.

- added Reynolds OI SST nov1981-now
3-nov-2000
- fixed bug introduced on 9-oct-2000 that caused the first year of each time

  correlation patterns (not yet done).
21-aug-2000
- added PSMSL tide-gauge stations, lots more data in Europe than JASL
18-aug-2000

  long timeseries)
- added JASL (SOEST) tide-gauge stations, again too many short ones
- fixed another bug in EOF routine, seems to work now.
10-aug-2000
- the bugs in EOFs are in the BLAS library.  Rolled my own.
9-aug-2000
- enabled EOFs, there still seem to be bugs though...
- fixed bug in get_index, which caused invalid points to turn up in timeseries
2-aug-2000
- the file upload mechanism is now public.  Please contact me if your netCDF
  files cause problems; I wrote a quick parser that could be much improved.

  plot, statistics, correlate with timeseries/other field.
25-jul-2000

  stored with the fields to a large extend.  Everything *should* work the 
  same, if not bug me.
20-jul-2000

NOTE TO MYSELF; to add a field follow the following 3 easy steps
1. make the field available in GrADS format (.dat and .ctl files), netCDF to come RSN
2. edit selectfield.html to include it in the list
3. edit queryfield.cgi to include it in the list
[Already quite streamlined, isn't it?]
