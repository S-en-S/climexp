<li>Starting month: [all] means that you get twelve values, one for
each month, [with seasons] groups all months together, [anomalies]
also subtracts the seasonal cycle.

<li>You can define the season to apply either to the time series you
selected first [timeseries], or the index you selected on this page
[index]

<li>A season is either defined as the [average] (sum in the case of
precipitation) of the months (one number per year), or by [selecting]
the specified months individually (<i>n</i> numbers per year)

<li>A lag of the form <i>m:n</i> gives a range of lags

<li>Begin year, End year: restrict data between these two years.

<li>Only for: restrict the range of the index or the data to the one
given (e.g., only El Ni&ntilde;os is indicated by NINO3 &gt; .5)

<li>Logarithmic: take logarithm of (precipitation) data before
correlating, zero is translated to 0.1 and negative values are ignored

<li>Sqrt: take sqrt of (precipitation) data before correlating,
negative values are ignored

<li>Rank correlation: a rank correlation is performed

<li>Contingency tables: 3x3, give the cut-off values in the fields
before, these can be specified as percentages

<li>Detrend: a linear trend is first subtracted per month from the
data and indices

<li>Differences: first the finite difference is taken: <i>f'(yr,month)
= f(yr+1,month) - f(yr,month)</i>

</ul>
