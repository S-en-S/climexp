<h2>Some notes on the ECMWF seasonal forecast fields</h2>

<p>Some fields of the ECMWF seasonal forecast system-1 have been
included to enable exploratory verification studies.  For real work
you'll need the raw data, which I am not allowed to redistribute.  A
lot of verification studies have also been done at the ECMWF.  Some
results are available at their <a href="http://www.ecmwf.int/"
target="_top">web server</a> when you manage to make yourself known as
an insider (based on IP address or ceritificate)..

<p>At the moment I have the ensemble means and ensembles of the following 
monthly mean fields
<ul>
<li>System-1
<ul>
<li>surface and 2m temperature [C], sea-level pressure [Pa], 
z500 [m2/s2] and 10m wind components [m/s].  Note that these are the 
instantaneous 00Z values, which may not be a good estimate of the daily mean.
<li>total precipitation [mm/month] and surface solar radiation [W/m2].
These are average rates for the month.
</ul>
<li>System-2
<ul>
<li>daily mean, min and max 2m temperature [C]
<li>850mb temperature [K], sealevel pressure [Pa], z500 [m2/s2], 10m
wind components [m/s], surface temperature [C] and now depth [m],
average of 00Z and 12Z.
<li>total precipitation [mm/month], downward surface solar radiation
[W/m2] averaged over the month.
</ul>
</ul>

<p>The fields are not homogeneous.  They consist of

<ul>
<li>System-1
<ul>
<li>1987-1990 research experiment, 5 ensemble members
started from 2 days before to 2 days after the first of each
month.
<li>1991-1996 hindcasts: monthly means from ensemble runs started at
the first of each month, 27 ensemble member in Jan, Apr, Jul and Oct,
11 ensemble members on the other months.
<li>1997-2001 forecasts: home-averaged monthly means from
daily means from ensemble members started one per day from the 16th
of the previous month to the 15 of the nominal one (up to mid-november
1997 three per week, afterwards daily).
</ul>
<li>System-2
<ul>
<li>1987-jul2001: hindcasts: 5 ensemble members started on the 1st of each
month, november and may starts have 41 ensemble members.
<li>aug-2001-dec2001: real-time forecasts with 40 enemble members all
started on the 1st of the month.
</ul>
</ul>

<p>Note that for system-1 the forecast would have been available
around the 28th of the month that the "+0" forecast refers to, the
system-2 forecatss are available around the 13th.

<p>The forecatss are available in two ways: either as "+0", "+1",
.. "+5" fields, in which the lead time is the same but the start dates
differ, or as "jan", "feb" ... "dec" fields, in which the start dates
are the same but the lead times differ.  The latter fields are of
course half empty, as the runs are only 6 months long.

<p>Some example analyses with step-by-step instructions are <a
href="ECMWF">here</a>.

<p>Please contact <a href="mailto:oldenborgh@knmi.nl">me</a> if you
have any questions or would like to have other variables included.
