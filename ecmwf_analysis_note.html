<h2><font color="#ff0000">Note on the ECMWF analyses</font></h2>

<p>The ECMWF analyses are the operational analyses over the period for
which seasonal forecasts are available.  These are *not* homogeneous.
In particular, the temperature in arid regions jumped up dramatically
in 1997.  There may be other problems in the dataset.  Use with care!

<p>I plan to replace these with ERA40 fields as soon as these are
available.
